# V1PolicyRulesWithSubjects

PolicyRulesWithSubjects prescribes a test that applies to a request to an apiserver. The test considers the subject making the request, the verb being requested, and the resource to be acted upon. This PolicyRulesWithSubjects matches a request if and only if both (a) at least one member of subjects matches the request and (b) at least one member of resourceRules or nonResourceRules matches the request.

v1_policy_rules_with_subjects_instance = V1PolicyRulesWithSubjects.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print V1PolicyRulesWithSubjects.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
v1_policy_rules_with_subjects_dict = v1_policy_rules_with_subjects_instance.to_dict()
