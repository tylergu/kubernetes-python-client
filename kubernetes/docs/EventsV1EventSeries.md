# EventsV1EventSeries

EventSeries contain information on series of events, i.e. thing that was/is happening continuously for some time. How often to update the EventSeries is up to the event reporters. The default event reporter in \"k8s.io/kubernetes.client-go/tools/events/event_broadcaster.go\" shows how this struct is updated on heartbeats and can guide customized reporter implementations.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**count** | **int** | count is the number of occurrences in this series up to the last heartbeat time. | 
**last_observed_time** | **datetime** | lastObservedTime is the time when last Event from the series was seen before last heartbeat. | 

## Example

```python
from kubernetes.client.models.events_v1_event_series import EventsV1EventSeries

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of EventsV1EventSeries from a JSON string
events_v1_event_series_instance = EventsV1EventSeries.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print EventsV1EventSeries.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
events_v1_event_series_dict = events_v1_event_series_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of EventsV1EventSeries from a dict
events_v1_event_series_form_dict = events_v1_event_series.from_dict(events_v1_event_series_dict)
