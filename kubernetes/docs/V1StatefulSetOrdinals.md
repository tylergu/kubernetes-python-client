# V1StatefulSetOrdinals

StatefulSetOrdinals describes the policy used for replica ordinal assignment in this StatefulSet.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**start** | **int** | start is the number representing the first replica&#39;s index. It may be used to number replicas from an alternate index (eg: 1-indexed) over the default 0-indexed names, or to orchestrate progressive movement of replicas from one StatefulSet to another. If set, replica indices will be in the range:   [.spec.ordinals.start, .spec.ordinals.start + .spec.replicas). If unset, defaults to 0. Replica indices will be in the range:   [0, .spec.replicas). | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from kubernetes.client.models.v1_stateful_set_ordinals import V1StatefulSetOrdinals

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of V1StatefulSetOrdinals from a JSON string
v1_stateful_set_ordinals_instance = V1StatefulSetOrdinals.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print V1StatefulSetOrdinals.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
v1_stateful_set_ordinals_dict = v1_stateful_set_ordinals_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of V1StatefulSetOrdinals from a dict
v1_stateful_set_ordinals_form_dict = v1_stateful_set_ordinals.from_dict(v1_stateful_set_ordinals_dict)
