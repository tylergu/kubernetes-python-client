# V1alpha2PodSchedulingContextSpec

PodSchedulingContextSpec describes where resources for the Pod are needed.

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**potential_nodes** | **List[str]** | PotentialNodes lists nodes where the Pod might be able to run.  The size of this field is limited to 128. This is large enough for many clusters. Larger clusters may need more attempts to find a node that suits all pending resources. This may get increased in the future, but not reduced. | [optional] 
**selected_node** | **str** | SelectedNode is the node for which allocation of ResourceClaims that are referenced by the Pod and that use \&quot;WaitForFirstConsumer\&quot; allocation is to be attempted. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from kubernetes.client.models.v1alpha2_pod_scheduling_context_spec import V1alpha2PodSchedulingContextSpec

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of V1alpha2PodSchedulingContextSpec from a JSON string
v1alpha2_pod_scheduling_context_spec_instance = V1alpha2PodSchedulingContextSpec.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print V1alpha2PodSchedulingContextSpec.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
v1alpha2_pod_scheduling_context_spec_dict = v1alpha2_pod_scheduling_context_spec_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of V1alpha2PodSchedulingContextSpec from a dict
v1alpha2_pod_scheduling_context_spec_form_dict = v1alpha2_pod_scheduling_context_spec.from_dict(v1alpha2_pod_scheduling_context_spec_dict)
