# V1SelfSubjectRulesReview

SelfSubjectRulesReview enumerates the set of actions the current user can perform within a namespace. The returned list of actions may be incomplete depending on the server's authorization mode, and any errors experienced during the evaluation. SelfSubjectRulesReview should be used by UIs to show/hide actions, or to quickly let an end user reason about their permissions. It should NOT Be used by external systems to drive authorization decisions as this raises confused deputy, cache lifetime/revocation, and correctness concerns. SubjectAccessReview, and LocalAccessReview are the correct way to defer authorization decisions to the API server.

```python
from kubernetes.client.models.v1_self_subject_rules_review import V1SelfSubjectRulesReview

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of V1SelfSubjectRulesReview from a JSON string
v1_self_subject_rules_review_instance = V1SelfSubjectRulesReview.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print V1SelfSubjectRulesReview.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
v1_self_subject_rules_review_dict = v1_self_subject_rules_review_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of V1SelfSubjectRulesReview from a dict
