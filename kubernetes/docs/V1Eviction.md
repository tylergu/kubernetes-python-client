# V1Eviction

Eviction evicts a pod from its node subject to certain policies and safety constraints. This is a subresource of Pod.  A request to cause such an eviction is created by POSTing to .../pods/<pod name>/evictions.

## Example

```python
from kubernetes.client.models.v1_eviction import V1Eviction

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of V1Eviction from a JSON string
v1_eviction_instance = V1Eviction.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print V1Eviction.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
v1_eviction_dict = v1_eviction_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of V1Eviction from a dict
v1_eviction_form_dict = v1_eviction.from_dict(v1_eviction_dict)
