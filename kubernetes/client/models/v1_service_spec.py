(Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will be dropped.) The default value, \"Cluster\", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from within the cluster will always get \"Cluster\" semantics, but clients sending to a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account when picking a node.", alias="externalTrafficPolicy")

If this field is specified manually, the requested family is available in the cluster, and ipFamilyPolicy allows it, it will be used; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field is conditionally mutable: it allows for adding or removing a secondary IP family, but it does not allow changing the primary IP family of the Service. Valid values are \"IPv4\" and \"IPv6\".  This field only applies to Services of types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and does apply to \"headless\" services.

This field can only be set when the Service type is 'LoadBalancer'. If not set, the default load balancer implementation is used, today this is typically done through the cloud provider integration, but should apply for any default implementation.

The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to propagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose of peer discovery.

Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.", alias="publishNotReadyAddresses")

Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is \"None\", no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather than a virtual IP. \"NodePort\" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. \"LoadBalancer\" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. \"ExternalName\" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
