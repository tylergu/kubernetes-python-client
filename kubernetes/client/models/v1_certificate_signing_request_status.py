If the signer cannot issue the certificate, a condition of type \"Failed\" is added and this field remains empty.  Validation requirements:  1. certificate must contain one or more PEM blocks.  2. All PEM blocks must have the \"CERTIFICATE\" label, contain no headers, and the encoded data   must be a BER-encoded ASN.1 Certificate structure as described in section 4 of RFC5280.  3. Non-PEM content may appear before or after the \"CERTIFICATE\" PEM blocks and is unvalidated,   to allow for explanatory text as described in section 5.2 of RFC7468.  If more than one PEM block is present, and the definition of the requested spec.signerName does not indicate otherwise, the first block is the issued certificate, and subsequent blocks should be treated as intermediate certificates and presented in TLS handshakes.
